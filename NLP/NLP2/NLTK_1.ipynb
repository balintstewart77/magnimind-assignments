    "# NLTK \n",
    "Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) is a comprehensive Python library for natural language processing and text analytics. Originally designed for teaching, it has been adopted in the industry for research and development due to its usefulness and breadth of coverage. NLTK is often used for rapid prototyping of text processing programs and can even be used in production applications. Demos of select NLTK functionality and production-ready APIs are available at http://text-processing.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenization\n",
    "Tokenization is a method of breaking up a piece of text into many pieces, such as sentences and words, and is an essential first step for recipes in the later chapters. \n",
    "\n",
    "**WordNet** is a dictionary designed for programmatic access by natural language processing systems. It has many different use cases, including:\n",
    "- Looking up the definition of a word\n",
    "- Finding synonyms and antonyms\n",
    "- Exploring word relations and similarity\n",
    "- Word sense disambiguation for words that have multiple uses and definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK includes a WordNet corpus reader, which we will use to access and explore WordNet.\n",
    "A corpus is just a body of text, and corpus readers are designed to make accessing a corpus much easier than direct file access. We'll be using WordNet again in the later chapters, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the basics first.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to install NLTK? \n",
    "Installation instructions for NLTK are available at http://nltk.org/install.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've installed NLTK, you'll also need to install the data following the instructions at http://nltk.org/data.html. I recommend installing everything, as we'll be using a number of corpora and pickled objects. The data is installed in a data directory, which on Mac and Linux/Unix is usually /usr/share/nltk_data, or on Windows is C:\\nltk_data. Make sure that tokenizers/punkt.zip is in the data directory and has been unpacked so that there's a file at tokenizers/punkt/PY3/english.pickle."

    "The RegexpTokenizer class works by compiling your pattern, then calling re.findall() on your text. You could do all this yourself using the re module, but RegexpTokenizer implements the TokenizerI interface, just like all the word tokenizers from the previous recipe. This means it can be used by other parts of the NLTK package, such as corpus readers, which we'll cover in detail in Chapter 3, Creating Custom Corpora. Many corpus readers need a way to tokenize the text they're reading, and can take optional keyword arguments specifying an instance of a TokenizerI subclass. This way, you have the ability to provide your own tokenizer instance if the default tokenizer is unsuitable.\n",
